## TricyCOOL

A game made in a game jam lasting a few hours with 4 people in our group. We got 3 random words to base it on, leading to a nonsensical game. Drive a tricycle shooting razors from your cannon up at coloured trousers, match the color. I ended up doing most of the non-graphical work.

I won our team glow-in-the-dark rubber ducks for the class-diagram I made :3
